# FinSage – Smart Finance Management Platform 💰
## 📌 Abstract

Managing personal finances can be difficult, especially for students and young professionals who are just beginning to handle expenses and savings. Many existing tools are either too complicated or fail to provide meaningful insights. **FinSage** addresses this challenge by offering a smart and user-friendly finance management platform that helps people track expenses, set budgets, and gain clarity over their spending patterns.

Built with modern technologies such as **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and Prisma**, FinSage delivers a fast, secure, and scalable solution. With the integration of the **Gemini API**, the system provides **AI-powered summaries and financial recommendations**, making financial data easy to understand. It also includes **automated reminders and email notifications powered by Resend**, ensuring users stay updated about their financial goals without extra effort.

The focus of FinSage is on **simplicity, accessibility, and financial literacy**. Instead of overwhelming users with technical details, it categorizes expenses clearly, highlights saving opportunities, and motivates users to improve their money habits. By combining intelligent automation with a **clean and intuitive interface**, FinSage empowers individuals to make smarter financial choices and move closer to financial stability.
